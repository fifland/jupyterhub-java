# JupyterHub-Java
### A simple all in one container for teaching Java

## Technical Overview

This image contains the tree needed software modules to simply run a multiuser Jupyter server:

* The multi-user manager JupyterHub
* The single-user Jupyter Notebooks to be spawned
* The [IJava-Kernel by Spencer Park](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) to execute java

### Main Purpose
By now the main purpose of this project is to be used in the bridging course for programming at the University of Applied Sciences Mittelhessen ([THM](http://mni.thm.de)) in Germany.

As not every student can bring his own notebook, or in some occasions the software simply does not run on their computer, this server is used as a fallback for those students.

### More is coming soon...
This Project is still under construction, expect more documentation to be coming soon ;)
